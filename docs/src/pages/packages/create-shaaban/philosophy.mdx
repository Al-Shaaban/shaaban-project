# Philosophy of Create Shaaban 🔮

The `create-shaaban` project follows a specific philosophy that is inspired by the
following principles and sticks with them accross its templates which consists of:

1. **Structured**: The project is structured in a way that is easy to understand and
   navigate. It is divided into different directories that each serve a specific purpose.

2. **Production Ready** (in progress 👉👈): All the templates are ready to be deployed and
   used.

3. **Customizable**: The project is highly customizable and allows you to change the code
   to fit your needs.

## Structure

The project is divided into the following directories:

      <FileTree.File name="create" />
      <FileTree.File name="get" />
      <FileTree.File name="update" />
      <FileTree.File name="delete" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="posts">
      <FileTree.File name="create" />
      <FileTree.File name="get" />
      <FileTree.File name="update" />
      <FileTree.File name="delete" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.Folder name="lib">
    <FileTree.Folder name="components">

</FileTree>

  Depending on the template, the structure may vary so make sure to check the
  documentation accordingly.
</Callout>

As you can see, the project is divided into different directories that each serve a
specific purpose. For example the `pages` folder contains all the pages of the website,
the `api` folder contains all the API routes, and the `lib` folder contains all the shared
components and utilities. This structure makes it easy to navigate and understand the
project. more on this topic can be found in each template page.

## Customization

The project is highly customizable and allows you to change the code to fit your needs.
You can start by editing the ui components in the `lib/ui` folder, or by changing the API
routes in the `api` folder. You can also add new pages to the website by creating new
files in the `pages` folder. The possibilities are endless and you can customize the
project in any way you want.
